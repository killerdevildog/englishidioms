*"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace."* — 1 Corinthians 14:33

This repository is dedicated to the glory of the Most High God. Language is a sacred gift—the means by which we communicate truth, share wisdom, and build understanding between peoples and generations.

Confusion is an enemy to clarity, and clarity is the path to truth. By preserving and organizing these idiomatic expressions across all languages, we seek to:

- **Help people understand language better** — making the richness of expressions accessible to all
- **Aid translations between languages** — bridging cultures from the past and well into the future
- **Eliminate confusion** — so that meaning may be preserved across time and tongues

May this work serve as a small contribution to the preservation of human understanding, for the benefit of all who seek knowledge and truth.
